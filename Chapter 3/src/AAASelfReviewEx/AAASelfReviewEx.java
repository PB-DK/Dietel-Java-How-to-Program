3.3)
    Local variables are only accessible by that 
    own single class. Fields are accessible by the
    whole class.
    A local variable is declared in the body of 
    a method and can be used only from the point 
    at which it’s declared through the end of 
    the method declaration. A field is declared 
    in a class, but not in the body of any of 
    the class’s methods. Also, fields are 
    accessible to all methods of the class.
    
3.4)
    A parameter represents additional 
    information that a method requires to 
    perform its task. Each parameter 
    required by a method is specified 
    in the method’s declaration. An 
    argument is the actual value for
    a method parameter. When a method 
    is called, the argument values are
    passed to the corresponding 
    parameters of the method so that
    it can perform its task.
    
3.5)
    Keyword new requests memory from 
    the system to store an object, 
    then calls the corresponding
    class’s constructor (p. 74) to
    initialize the object.
    
3.6)
    If a class does not define 
    constructors, the compiler 
    provides a default constructor 
    (p. 85) with no parameters, 
    and the class’s instance 
    variables are initialized 
    to their default values.
    
3.7)
    An instance variable is a 
    parameter which can be used
    throughout the whole class
    
3.8)
    Classes System and String are
    in package java.lang, which
    is implicitly imported into
    every Java program, so all
    programs can use that package’s
    classes without explicitly 
    importing them. Most other 
    classes you’ll use in Java 
    programs must be imported 
    explicitly.
    
3.9)
    Import declaration indicates 
    to the compiler that the 
    program uses class Scanner. 
    Classes System and String 
    are in package java.lang, 
    which is implicitly imported 
    into 
    every Java program, so all 
    programs can use that 
    package’s classes without 
    explicitly importing them. 
    Most other classes you’ll 
    use in Java programs must 
    be imported explicitly.
    There’s a special 
    relationship between
    
3.10)
    An instance variable is 
    typically declared private 
    in a class so that only 
    the methods of the class 
    in which the instance 
    variable is declared can 
    manipulate the variable. 
    In some cases, it may be 
    necessary for an application
    to modify the private data. 
    For example, the owner of a
    bank account should be able 
    to deposit or withdraw funds
    and check the account’s 
    balance. A class’s designer 
    can provide public set and get
    methods that enable an 
    application to specify the 
    value for, or retrieve the 
    value of, a particular 
    object’s private instance 
    variable.
